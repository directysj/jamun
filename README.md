### Summary
Conformational ensembles of protein structures are immensely important both for understanding protein function and drug discovery in novel modalities such as cryptic pockets. Current techniques for sampling ensembles such as molecular dynamics (MD) are computationally inefficient, while many recent machine learning methods do not generalize well outside their training data. We propose JAMUN which performs MD in a smoothed, noised space of all-atom 3D conformations of molecules by utilizing the framework of walk-jump sampling. JAMUN enables ensemble generation for small peptides at rates of an order of magnitude faster than traditional molecular dynamics.
The physical priors in JAMUN enables transferability to systems outside of its training data, even to peptides that are longer than those originally trained on.

An overview of the walk-jump sampling scheme, which is similar to classical molecular dynamics, but in a smoothed space:

## Setup

Clone the repository with HTTPS:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun.git
```
or SSH:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:prescient-design/jamun.git
```

Navigate to the cloned repository:
```bash
cd jamun
```

We recommend creating a [`mamba`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) or [`conda`](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#install) environment.
This is because certain dependencies are tricky to install directly.
```bash
conda create --name jamun python=3.11 -y
conda activate jamun
conda install -c conda-forge ambertools=23 openmm pdbfixer pyemma -y
conda install pulchra -c bioconda -y
```

The remaining dependencies can be installed via `pip` or [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (recommended).
```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```


## Data

The uncapped 2AA data from [Timewarp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01170) can be obtained from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/timewarp).
```bash
cd /path/to/data/root/
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/timewarp
```
where `/path/to/data/root/` is the path where you want to store the datasets.

This should be your directory structure:
```bash
/path/to/data/root/
└── timewarp/
    ├── 2AA-1-big/
    │   └── ...
    ├── 2AA-1-large/
    │   └── ...
```
Now, set the environment variable `JAMUN_DATA_PATH`:
```bash
export JAMUN_DATA_PATH=/path/to/data/root/
```
or, create a `.env` file in the root of the repository and set `JAMUN_DATA_PATH`:
```txt
JAMUN_DATA_PATH=/path/to/data/root/
```

Set the environment variable `JAMUN_ROOT_PATH` (default: current directory) to specify where outputs from training and sampling are saved:
```bash
export JAMUN_ROOT_PATH=...
```
or in the .env file in the root of the repository:
```txt
JAMUN_ROOT_PATH=...
```

## Training

Once you have downloaded the data and set the appropriate variables correctly,
you can start training on Timewarp.

We recommend first running our test config (on one GPU) to check that installation was successful:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 jamun_train --config-dir=configs experiment=train_test.yaml
```

Then, you can train on the uncapped 2AA peptides dataset:
```bash
jamun_train --config-dir=configs experiment=train_uncapped_2AA.yaml
```

or the uncapped 4AA peptides dataset:
```bash
jamun_train --config-dir=configs experiment=train_uncapped_4AA.yaml
```

We also provide example [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) launcher scripts for [training](https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun/blob/main/scripts/slurm/train.sh) and [sampling](https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun/blob/main/scripts/slurm/sample.sh) on SLURM clusters:
```bash
sbatch scripts/slurm/train.sh
sbatch scripts/slurm/sample.sh
```

## Inference

### Loading Trained Models

We provide trained models (for both sampling, and restarting training) for Timewarp 2AA, Timewarp 4AA, MDGen 4AA and other datasets at https://huggingface.co/ameya98/JAMUN:

```bash
# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/ameya98/JAMUN
```

If you want to test out your own trained model,
either specify the `wandb_train_run_path` (in the form `entity/project/run_id`, which can be obtained from the Overview tab in the Weights and Biases UI for your training run), or the `checkpoint_dir` of the trained model.

```bash
jamun_sample ... ++wandb_train_run_path=[WANDB_TRAIN_RUN_PATH]
jamun_sample ... ++checkpoint_dir=[CHECKPOINT_DIR]
```

### Sampling Conformations for a Peptide Sequence

If you want to sample conformations for a particular peptide sequence, you need to first generate a `.pdb` file.

We provide a script that uses [AmberTools](https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php), specifically `tleap`. If you have a `.pdb` file already, then you can skip this step.

#### Generate `.pdb` file

Run:
```bash
python scripts/prepare_pdb.py [SEQUENCE] --mode [MODE] --outputdir [OUTPUTDIR]
```
where `SEQUENCE` is your peptide sequence entered as a string of one-letter codes (eg. AGPF) or a string of hyphenated three letter codes (eg. ALA-GLY-PRO-PHE), `MODE` is either `capped` or `uncapped` to add capping ACE and NME residues, and `OUTPUTDIR` is where your generated `.pdb` file will be saved (default is current directory).
The script will print out the path to the generated  `.pdb` file, `INIT_PDB`.

#### Run sampling on `.pdb`
Run the sampling script, starting from the provided `.pdb` structure:
```bash
jamun_sample --config-dir=configs experiment=sample_custom ++init_pdb=[INIT_PDB]
```

### Sampling Test Peptides from Timewarp

We also provide some configs to sample from the uncapped 2AA and 4AA peptides from the test set in Timewarp.

```bash
jamun_sample --config-dir=configs experiment=sample_uncapped_2AA.yaml checkpoint_dir=...

jamun_sample --config-dir=configs experiment=sample_uncapped_4AA.yaml checkpoint_dir=...
```

## Analysis

We provide scripts for analysing JAMUN and original MD trajectories in [https://github.com/prescient-design/jamun/tree/main/analysis].

## Data Generation

### Running Molecular Dynamics with OpenMM

We provide scripts for generating MD simulation data with [OpenMM](https://openmm.org/), including energy minimization and calibration steps with NVT and NPT ensembles.

```bash
python scripts/generate_data/run_simulation.py [INIT_PDB]
```

The defaults correspond to our setup for the capped diamines.
Please run this script with the `-h` flag to see all simulation parameters.

### Preprocessing

Some of the datasets require some preprocessing for easier consumption, for eg. the MDGen data:

```bash
source .env
python scripts/process_mdgen.py \
  --input-dir ${JAMUN_DATA_PATH}/mdgen \
  --output-dir ${JAMUN_DATA_PATH}/mdgen/data/4AA_sims_partitioned_chunked
```
